A robust, AI-powered currency exchange forecasting application that supports live rate tracking, conversion, and predictive analytics across 20+ countries. This project uses machine learning models to forecast exchange rate trends and provides real-time conversions using integrated APIs.

🔧 Features
🔁 Live Currency Conversion: Real-time currency conversion across 20+ global currencies using a public/exchange rate API (e.g., ExchangeRate-API, Forex Python, or similar).

📈 Forecasting Engine: Time-series forecasting models (ARIMA, Prophet, or LSTM) to predict exchange rate movements.

🌍 Country Support: Supports major currencies like USD, EUR, GBP, INR, JPY, AUD, CAD, and more.

📊 Visualization Dashboard: Matplotlib/Plotly-based charts showing historical trends, predicted rates, and comparative analysis.

🧠 AI/ML Models: Uses ML pipelines for trend analysis and forecasting based on historical currency data.

🧪 Testing & Error Handling: Built-in error detection for API failures, rate-lagging, and data inconsistencies.

🚀 Modular & Scalable Design: Easily extensible for additional currencies, model improvements, or integration into fintech apps.
